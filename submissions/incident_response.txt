1. Incident commander name:
    Suspicious CPU activity was detected, leading to the discovery of a cryptomining attack.

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   An incident occurred where suspicious CPU activity was detected, indicating a cryptomining attack. The investigation revealed the presence of three pods running different crypto miners, specifically moneropool, minergate, and cryptonight containers. It was determined that an attacker had gained control of the cluster and exploited its compute resources for crypto-mining purposes. The incident was reported by the Falco monitoring runtime, and the administrator was able to visualize the anomalous activity using Grafana.

3. Summary of what was affected:
   The incident primarily affected the CPU resources, which experienced a significant spike due to the unauthorized use of compute resources by the attacker.

4. Summary of the impact:
   The impact of the incident was observed through monitoring reports showing substantial CPU utilization spikes.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
   The following steps were taken to remediate the incident:
   - Pods involved in the attack were terminated using the command `kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force`.
   - The stability of CPU activity was verified to ensure it returned to normal levels.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   The incident highlighted the following key lessons:
   - It is essential to review and strengthen access controls for the Kubernetes API server from administrative terminals and Grafana dashboards.
   - Configuring admission controllers to disallow the use of unknown images for creating containers can enhance security.
   - Prioritizing Falco rules for the metrics endpoint at the highest level can improve the detection and response to such incidents in the future.
